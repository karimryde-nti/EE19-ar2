            <p>NGC 2275 is classified as a flocculent (or fluffy-looking) spiral galaxy, located 67 million light-years away in the constellation of Cancer. Millions of bright, young, blue stars shine in the complex, feather-like spiral arms, interlaced with dark lanes of dust.</p>

            <p>The blue and orange stars of the faint galaxy named NGC 2188 sparkle in this Hubble image. NGC 2188 is estimated to be about 50,000 light-years across, which would make it roughly half the size of our Milky Way galaxy.</p>

            <p>Globular cluster NGC 1805, a tight grouping of thousands of stars is, located near the edge of the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way. In the dense center of one of these clusters, stars are 100 to 1,000 times closer together than the nearest stars are to our Sun.</p>

            <p>This stunning barred spiral galaxy, NGC 2835, has a width of just over half that of the Milky Way. The twisting patterns created by the multiple spiral arms of NGC 2835 create the illusion of an eye. This is a fitting description, as this magnificent galaxy resides near the head of the southern constellation of Hydra, the water snake.</p>
